# The Banana Archive
My personal and simple self-hosted web site, hosted with apache2.

No images are provided, only the pages and utilities.

## What is this?

The Banana Archive is my web server that I host on my desktop (globally) and laptop (LAN) mainly to share files to friends or to myself to another location. The server is hosted with apache2 and assumes that the hosted directory is /var/www/html/.
